# Django Simple Project

**Do not run this in production.**

This "Hello World" project is a minimum viable Django, with none of the best practices. 

The included `db.sqlite3` has migrations and an `admin/admin` super user. 

If deployed, the data will not persist. 

If you're after persistant storage, properly hosted static, and security, check out the [Django on Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/python/django/run) tutorial.
